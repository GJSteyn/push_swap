usage:		ARG="random numbers go here" ; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG [-v] [-d] [-h]
		Checker only: ./checker $ARG [-v] [-d] [-h]
		If you want random numbers generated automatically, you can use this nifty ruby
		snippet: ARG=`ruby -e "puts (0..49).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`

v:		Visualizer. Uses curses (curses.h) to print a visual representation of
		stacks as operations are processed. Can not be used in conjuction with the other
		options (visualizer doesn't initialize if you try).

d:		Debug. Shows stacks with the values they contain as well as the current
		operation. Overrides the visualizer.

h:		Help. Prints this usage section regardless of other selected options.
